**Summary**

A highly motivated software engineer with experience in full-stack web development, embedded systems, and AI. Proven ability to architect scalable solutions, lead technical teams, and deliver quantifiable results in fast-paced environments. Seeking to leverage a diverse skill set to build innovative and impactful technology.

**Education**

University of California Davis, Davis, CA
Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (Sep. 2022 – Jun 2026)
Relevant Coursework: Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Advanced Algorithms, Solid-State Devices, Embedded Systems, Computer Architecture, Applied Probability, Digital Signal Processing.

**Experience**

**AI Engineering Intern** - GoDaddy, Kirkland, WA (June 2025 – Sep 2025)
Saved 23,000+ hours annually by developing a custom AI contract parsing tool using AWS Bedrock and integrating it with Jira, Slack, and Ironclad APIs. This increased initial submission accuracy to over 90% and cut legal correction time by 40%. Migrated a customer portal with over 5,000 monthly users to a React and Node.js BFF architecture, reducing load time by 35% and lifting user engagement by 15% via a new support chatbot. Architected and implemented a full CI/CD pipeline from scratch using GitHub Actions for automated testing (Jest/Cypress) and deployment.

**Technical Lead** - Google Student Developer Club, Davis, CA (October 2024 – Present)
Led a team of five to fine-tune a ResNet-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify meat freshness, achieving 95% classification accuracy through optimized model architecture and data preprocessing. Managed the team's end-to-end version control with Git, enforcing clean commit practices and resolving merge conflicts.

**Projects**

**AI Drag and Drop Website Generator** (Go, Google Cloud Run, Docker, Gemini, React)
Architected a scalable, serverless back-end with a containerized Go application on Google Cloud Run to handle a 150% user activity spike, generating over 100 user websites on day one. Designed the back-end to interface with the Gemini API and scale to zero, maintaining a $0 operational budget since launch.

**WebSockets Based Multiplayer Game** (WebSockets, SQL, node.js)
Built a real-time database and state synchronization system from scratch using a WebSocket server. Engineered scalable back-end services using Node.js and Supabase to achieve 99% uptime over 12 months, with gameplay and chat latency under 200ms.

**Embedded IoT Bike Tracker** (AWS, CC3200, UART, I2C, SPI)
Developed an embedded GPS tracking solution on a TI CC3200 MCU with interrupt-driven firmware in C. Integrated an I2C accelerometer for crash detection and an SPI OLED for telemetry, with secure connectivity to AWS IoT Core using TLS 1.2 for 100% reliable data transfer.

**Hardware-Accelerated Matrix Multiplication** (FPGA, Verilog, ModelSim)
Designed an 8×8 systolic array processor inspired by TPU architecture, reducing matrix multiplication execution time by 88% (from 550 to 64 clock cycles). This parallel-MAC design achieved a 64x throughput improvement over a single MAC design while using only 22% of FPGA logic on a DE10 board.

**Personal AI Chatbot & RAG System (this site)** (Python, FastAPI, Google Cloud Run, MongoDB, Gemini API)
Architected and built a full end-to-end RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to serve as an intelligent AI chatbot for my personal website. Developed a serverless back-end using **Python** and **FastAPI**, containerized it with **Docker**, and deployed it on **Google Cloud Run** for a high-performance, cost-effective solution that scales to zero. Implemented a sophisticated vector database using **MongoDB Atlas Vector Search** to store and retrieve contextual information from my resume and project documents. The system uses the **Google Gemini API** for both generating embeddings and synthesizing final, context-aware responses.

**Logi-Sim** (React, Zustand Store) - logi-sim.web.app
Designed and integrated complex digital circuits, including full adders and flip-flops. Optimized state management with Zustand, reducing simulation load time by 40% for large projects. Implemented dynamic circuit updates using depth-first search, improving simulation accuracy by 25%.

**Sound Following Bot** (Embedded Systems, C++, Circuit Design)
Designed and built a directional sound-following robot using a dual microphone pre-amplifier circuit and an MSP microcontroller. Implemented real-time sound localization and PWM motor control in C++ for responsive, smooth movement.

**Technical Skills**

Languages: Python, C/C++, Go, SQL, JavaScript (Node.js, React), HTML/CSS, Verilog
AI/ML: TensorFlow, PyTorch, AWS Bedrock, Gemini API
Cloud/DevOps: AWS (IoT Core, Lambda), Google Cloud Run, Docker, GitHub Actions, Firebase
Hardware & Tools: Digital Logic, FPGA, Embedded Systems, RISC-V, ARM, Quartus, ModelSim, Git, Linux, Supabase

**Personal Favorites and Philosophy**

While I'm proud of all my work, my favorite project is the **AI Drag and Drop Website Generator**. I found it incredibly rewarding to architect a high-performance Go backend on a serverless platform and see it successfully handle a massive user spike on day one. It combined my passions for scalable system design, AI integration, and creating tools that empower users. The challenge of maintaining a $0 operational budget also pushed me to be a more efficient and creative engineer.

**Why Hire Me?**

I am a results-driven engineer who excels at bridging the gap between complex software challenges and tangible business impact. At GoDaddy, I demonstrated this by architecting and delivering an AI contract parsing tool that saved over **23,000 hours** of manual work annually and cut legal correction time by 40%. Beyond pure efficiency gains, I have a proven track record of modernizing technology and improving user experience, such as when I migrated a legacy customer portal to a modern React and Node.js stack, reducing load times by 35% and lifting user engagement by 15%. I built the entire CI/CD pipeline for that project from scratch, showcasing my ability to own a project's full lifecycle.

My experience extends from high-level AI applications to low-level hardware design. As a Technical Lead for the Google Student Developer Club, I guided a team to achieve 95% accuracy on a custom CNN model. In my personal projects, I've architected a scalable, serverless Go backend on Google Cloud Run for an AI website generator that handled a 150% user spike while maintaining a **$0 operational budget**. This breadth of experience, from designing a hardware-accelerated processor in Verilog to building real-time WebSocket applications, gives me a unique, full-stack perspective. I bring not just a diverse technical skill set but a proven ability to lead, innovate, and deliver robust, efficient solutions from the ground up.
